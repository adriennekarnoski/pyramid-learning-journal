          but after I finally understood how it all worked together it got better.\
          I wouldn't say easier, because I still feel like everything could\
          break at any given second and I know it's going to get worse the\
          more we add, but I definitely understand what's going on now.\
          Also, we learned cookiecutter, which is the best thing ever.\
          Although it brings more potential moments of self destruction,\
          it helps you make sure nothing was forgotten and starts your project off right.\
          Even if it only stays that way until I get my hands on it."
