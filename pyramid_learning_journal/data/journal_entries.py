    "title": "First Day of School",
    "date": "16 October, 2017",
    "body": "Starting out the day we jumped into using a virtual environment. A tool used to isolate our projects where we can import libraries and modules for a given project while avoiding conflicts with existing ones. The first thing we installed to our virtual environment was iPython, the interpreter we'll be using in class, and began working with basic Python syntax. We covered the three basic types of lines of code: comments, expressions, and statements, along with the styling and comparison of both Python versions. After covering the basic introduction to the language we jumped into customizing our text editor and breaking functions to throw exceptions."

    "title": "Testing, Testing",
    "date": "17 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned how quickly I can get lost if I pay too much attention to writing notes and not enough watching actual code be written. It's tempting to copy everything that is laid out in the discussion that day, but I'm discovering I would much rather write all of that later and actually watch the code being written as it's talked about. Besides that, we learned more about Python syntax and the basics of test driven development, and then started out assignment for the day. Luckily the assignment mostly dealt with testing, because it was nice to practice what we just learned."

    "title": "Learning the 'Whys'",
    "date": "18 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned more about the Python syntax. I'm still trying to break away from referring to things in my code like it's Javascript (e.g. lists instead of arrays) but it's getting easier. We went through sequences and the operations they should support, such as indexing, slicing, membership, etc. Indexing is using the (you'd never guess) index of an object to get it's position in a sequence, whereas slicing allows you to get a new sequence containing elements from the original list. After that we moved on to string features, dictionaries, and sets. I tried to focus a lot on the 'whys of each topic, like why we would use something instead of something else and really what the benefits were. It's easier for me to remember how to use something if I spend a lot of time understanding why we use it first. At the end of lecture we learned about reading files, which came into play in our lab today because we had to open a book file and use it in our code to make a trigram. Our trigram came out awesome, too, and it was really fun to build. It blows my mind what we can already create, and I can't wait to see what else we accomplish."

    "id": 4,
    "title": "Tox Testing",
    "date": "19 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned more of the Python syntax like list and tuples, as well as mutability and mutable sequence methods. After that I learned about tox, which is a packaged used to run tests in both Python 2 and Python 3 environments. Most of my evening was spent googling how to make my setup.py file work, because even though it seems easy enough, it broke more times than I can count. I finally got it working and I'm about 83 percent sure it's right, but I also feel like it's waiting for me to let my guard down so it can destroy the whole project. Besides lecture, the biggest thing I learned from today was actually our assignment. Seeing how all the pieces worked together and creating functions that depended on other function really showed the importance of code organization and lots of tests."

    "title": "Code Wars: 1, Adrienne:0",
    "date": "20 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned a big lesson on time management when it came to code wars. I ended up spending too much time on the more challenging kata and a couple times ended up not being able to make them pass the kata tests, which resulted in spending more time trying to get my own tests to fail to see what was wrong. I think next time I'll knock out a solid amount of the shorter problems first and then judge my time to see if I should take on a bigger challenge instead of jumping into them right away. I think I created more stress for myself than was necessary, but now I know for next time."

    "id": 6,
    "title": "Socket to Me",
    "date": "23 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned about TCP/IP and sockets, and the linked list data structure. Putting everything into practice wasn't too bad. We got out echo server up and running after a while, and I think I have a much better grasp on the linked lists now that I understand that it is not in fact a normal python list."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "title": "Like a String Telephone, But Different",
    "date": "24 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned about the HTTP protocol which was a little bit like 301 but with some chaos sprinkled on top. It's nice to be able to see your code send messages back and forth from client to server, but sometimes it just disappears and I was stuck wondering where it went. For the data structure today we learned about stacks, which was essentially just last-in first-out version of our linked list. After making our class inherit from our code yesterday it was easy to make our tests all pass. Almost too easy. We spent a lot of time being skeptical and staring at our code, convinced we missed something. But I guess it just showed us the importance of class inheritance and composition."

    "title": "Whiteboard Challenge: Accepted",
    "date": "25 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned a little more about classes and pytest fixtures, and then we have a whiteboard challenge. My partner and I did a really good job, even though we over thought it to begin with. We made it way harder than it needed to be and then finally figured out were on the right track to begin with, so we simplified everything and finally finished it up. Later we did doubly linked lists, which I'm really tired of typing at this point. They're pretty fun to make and work with, but can turn into a hot mess real quick."

    "id": 9,
    "title": "Life After Code Fellows",
    "date": "26 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned a lot about what a job would/could/should be like after Code Fellows. It definitely made me even more excited about about getting a job after graduation, which is weird because I've never done something where I'm like, 'hell yeah, I'm gonna do this same exact thing for the rest of my life!' I've really enjoyed learning to use the python language through building data structures and hopefully (although unlikely) if I have free time I can explore more into some algorithms as well. Also I'm learning about blockchains because I'd like to do some mining, but I don't want my computer to burst into flames."

  {
    "id": 10,
    "title": "Walkers and Runners",
    "date": "27 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today I learned about using walkers and runner to find cycles in linked lists, which is a very simple solution compared to trying to solve that issue before knowing about them. My partner and I still did a really good job on our whiteboard challenge, even without using them. We maybe didn't come up with the 'correct' solution, but we did figure out two other ways that worked. So that was cool. Now it's just time to mentally prepare for week three!"

    "id": 11,
    "title": "Pyramid: The Peak of Chaos",
    "date": "30 October, 2017",
    "body": "So today we learned about pyramid, which was chaos at first, but after I finally understood how it all worked together it got better. I wouldn't say easier, because I still feel like everything could break at any given second and I know it's going to get worse the more we add, but I definitely understand what's going on now. Also, we learned cookiecutter, which is the best thing ever. Although it brings more potential moments of self destruction, it helps you make sure nothing was forgotten and starts your project off right. Even if it only stays that way until I get my hands on it."

    "id": 12,
    "title": "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back",
    "date": "31 October, 2017",
    "body": "Today, for our data structure we learned about binary heaps. They're ridiculously easy to explain or draw, but getting it all down in code can make you want to pull your eyebrows off. I'm starting to notice, especially for data structures, my partner and I are starting to get in the python groove of things. It's easier to describe what we're trying to do, instead of saying 'the thing that does that one thing' over and over until the other person gets it. As for the learning journal we're making... I was really excited to finish up stuff from yesterday and knock out today, and everything was going great until Heroku ruined the small glimmer of happiness I was experiencing. And I'm not just saying Heroku didn't work, I mean it destroyed itself and everything around it. Not cool"

    "id": 13,
    "title": "Lucky Number 13",
    "date": "01 November, 2017",
    "body": "Today, day 13, I learned about using SQLAlchemy to store our journal entries in a database. It took a lot of work to get all the pieces working together, but once they finally were it was easier to see the big picture. The hardest thing I find about databases, especially when it comes to using SQlAlchemy, is not being able to check each individual step. You either build everything right and it works, or you miss something and the data gets lost along the way and you have to go back through each step and find where it's broken. On top of our learning journal we also did a primary queue and made more planning for our project. It's hard to switch mindsets from assignment to assignment and not get stuck pondering what you need to work on other than the current task at hand. So I'd also say I'm learning how to find a balance between cramming as much information into my brain as possible and still being a semi-functional human being."

    "id": 14,
    "title": "Persistence: Essential For Personal Growth, and Also Data",
    "date": "02 November, 2017",
    "body": "Today we learned more about working with the database, and how to edit or add new data from user input. It started with just changing stuff up in the code, and ended with deciphering an obnoxious amount of error messages. After the storm settled it was really cool to be able to add new articles or delete them and actually have persistent data. Although I've made a lot of progress on the learning journal, I don't think I've written a doc string in like two days. You'd think with everything that pyramid can do it would take care of that for you. Maybe I'll make a package."
