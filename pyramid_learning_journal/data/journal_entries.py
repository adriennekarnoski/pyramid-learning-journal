          but after I finally understood how it all worked together it got better.\
          I wouldn't say easier, because I still feel like everything could\
          break at any given second and I know it's going to get worse the\
          more we add, but I definitely understand what's going on now.\
          Also, we learned cookiecutter, which is the best thing ever.\
          Although it brings more potential moments of self destruction,\
          it helps you make sure nothing was forgotten and starts your project off right.\
          Even if it only stays that way until I get my hands on it."

      'body': "Today, for our data structure we learned about binary heaps.\
      They're ridiculously easy to explain or draw, but getting it all down\
       in code can make you want to pull your eyebrows off. \
       I'm starting to notice, especially for data structures, \
       my partner and I are starting to get in the python groove of things. \
       It's easier to describe what we're trying to do, instead of saying \
       'the thing that does that one thing' over and over until the other \
       person gets it.\
      As for the learning journal we're making... \
      I was really excited to finish up stuff from yesterday \
      and knock out today, and everything was going great until \
      Heroku ruined the small glimmer of happiness I was experiencing. \
      And I'm not just saying Heroku didn't work, I mean it destroyed \
      itself and everything around it. Not cool"
