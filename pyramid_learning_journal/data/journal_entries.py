          but after I finally understood how it all worked together \
          it got better.I wouldn't say easier, because I still feel like \
          everything could break at any given second and I know it's going \
          to get worse the more we add, \
          but I definitely understand what's going on now.\
          Also, we learned cookiecutter, which is the best thing ever.\
          Although it brings more potential moments of self destruction,\
          it helps you make sure nothing was forgotten \
          and starts your project off right.\
          Even if it only stays that way until I get my hands on it."

      'body': "Today, for our data structure we learned about binary heaps.\
      They're ridiculously easy to explain or draw, but getting it all down\
       in code can make you want to pull your eyebrows off. \
       I'm starting to notice, especially for data structures, \
       my partner and I are starting to get in the python groove of things. \
       It's easier to describe what we're trying to do, instead of saying \
       'the thing that does that one thing' over and over until the other \
       person gets it.\
       As for the learning journal we're making... \
       I was really excited to finish up stuff from yesterday \
       and knock out today, and everything was going great until \
       Heroku ruined the small glimmer of happiness I was experiencing. \
       And I'm not just saying Heroku didn't work, I mean it destroyed \
       itself and everything around it. Not cool"

      'date': '01 November, 2017',
      'tags': "database, data structures",
      'body': "Today, day 13, I learned about using SQLAlchemy to store \
      our journal entries in a database. It took a lot of work to get all \
      the pieces working together, but once they finally were it was easier \
      to see the big picture. The hardest thing I find about databases, \
      especially when it comes to using SQlAlchemy, is not being able \
      to check each individual step. You either build everything right \
      and it works, or you miss something and the data gets lost along \
      the way and you have to go back through each step and find where \
      it's broken. On top of our learning journal we also did a primary \
      queue and made more planning for our project. It's hard to switch \
      mindsets from assignment to assignment and not get stuck pondering \
      what you need to work on other than the current task at hand. \
      So I'd also say I'm learning how to find a balance between \
      cramming as much information into my brain as possible and still \
      being a semi-functional human being."
